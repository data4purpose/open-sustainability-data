# open-sustainability-data
A playground for data innovation. Imagine a world in which sustainability data is publicly shared, what information would you contribute, and for what purpose??

## Overview
This project contains descriptions and demo code for case studies, which have been conducted by
the OfCC team and ecolytiq in preparation for the __open-sustainability-data-initiative__ (OSDI).

Our goal is to illustrate how we can have initial results in a short periode of time, assuming we start 
now with real action. Instead of waiting for governments to tell us what data must be shared by whom,
we'd rather find out, what data we want to share for which purpose.

This is a traditional chicken-egg problem. 

We solve it by simply defining and standardizing data structures, based on existing public documents, 
and ESG reports: We start with our own vision and simply imagine what kind of data can become useful 
for arbitrary use cases anytime soon.

In addition, we envision use cases which may help consumers and decision-makers. Describing the
demand from their point of view unveils the existing gap in our current data landscape. We can start defining
more datastructures, which should be shared in the future.

This drives another activity: Building a data sharing infrastructure. This can be internally, within organizations,
across partners, e.g., in research projects, supply chains or large colaboration projects, and later, eventually on a global scale.
